# Kittygram

## Description

- This project uses YandexPracticum's React template (frontend) & serves for your favourite cats to be added & boasted of online;
- The motivation behind is better learn this backend dev stack & include it in my portfolio;
- Once modified locally & pushed to its GitHub repo, this project moves on along the yaml-based orchestration lines to rebuild the docker images accordingly & auto-redeploy the project to the live server; the associated Telegram bot will notify me about the deployment;
- If you're passionate about sharing your feline pet's pix online & seeing same from other cat people, please head for the [website](https://kittygramme.zapto.org/), sign up & on.
